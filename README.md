# satellite-sim
The Idea about the way to create a simulation was taken from https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Planet-Simulation

This is a simulation is intended to visualize the movement of artificial satellites to create the communication system.
The main goal is to get the data when the connection is present between two satellites.

Simulation uses real coordinates according to the given dates.
